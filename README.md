# Calculator App 

This was a self-project after finishing this project I feel 20 times more comfortable with Python.
I learned more about designing and managing the GUI but the most difficult part ofthe project was making the rules for when each button could be clicked.

## Look of the GUI

## Technologies used
I used Visual Studio Code as my IDE , Python 3.8.7 as my language and also used the PySimpleGUI as the library to help me build the GUI.
